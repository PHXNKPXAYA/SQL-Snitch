# SQL Snitch - SQL Injection Scanner

**SQL Snitch** is a tool designed to scan web applications for SQL injection vulnerabilities. It automates the process of testing different SQL injection payloads against a target website and checks for vulnerabilities based on common SQL errors in the response. This tool is for **educational purposes only** and should only be used with permission.

## Features

- **SQL Injection Scanning**: Automatically scans websites for SQL injection vulnerabilities using predefined payloads.
- **Multiple Scan Types**: Choose between different scan depths:
  - **Light**: Basic injection payloads.
  - **Deep**: More complex payloads for a deeper scan.
  - **Full**: A comprehensive scan using a wider range of payloads.
- **Parameter Scanning**: Scan specific URL parameters for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Progress Tracking**: Uses `tqdm` to provide a real-time progress bar, displaying estimated time for the scan completion.
- **Error Detection**: Detects common SQL error messages to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction and input.
